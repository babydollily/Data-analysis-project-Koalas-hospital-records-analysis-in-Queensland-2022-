1.1 Research Aim and Motivation
The research is to investigate the many causes of the decline in the number of Koalas in Queensland.
This project's dataset was obtained from the Queensland Government Open Portal, which contains data from 1996 to 2022. Our study analysis revealed the primary causes of injured, sick and dead koalas in the wild. Also attempted to comprehend the many patterns of these reasons, which change by year and location.
Koalas are endemic to Australia, but their numbers have been declining. We hope that our initiative will act as a motivator for stakeholders such as the Animal Protection Organization, the State Government, and the local community in order to raise awareness about this problem. We believe that our study sheds light on the issue and aids to the preservation and prevention of Kolas in society.


1.2 Summary of Results
The primary insights from this study are that by successfully understanding these prediction models, we will be able to maintain Koloas in the future, particularly in Queensland suburbs, thereby helping to safeguard Australia's fauna.
The research has essentially accomplished its purpose, acquiring several insights via the use of many types of models and categorisation approaches. We were able to determine the primary causes of mortality in Koalas, which were strongly connected to the various variables of injury and disease. This research also helps to provide light on how these figures change between locations and years. In conclusion, we discussed several crucial techniques for preventing Koala population declines.
